Purpose of this exercise:

I'd like evaluate GO buildin /net/rpc package before trying out grpc

Usage:
-- start server
go run server/server.go

-- start client and login chatter
go run client/client.go chatter_name

Basic functionality:

This is a chat room project that supports 4 basic actions: Login, Logout, Post, and Listen
Login and Logout only need chatter name provided   
Post will post a message to the server along with chatter name. The message will be broadcasted to all other logged in chatters   
Listen runs on the background once a chatter logs in. It retrive messages posted by other chatters

Conclusion about RPC package:
Generally easy to use. 
Does not support streaming (at least afaik).

Todo:
Adding a command line UI would be cool, probably using TUI.
Try out g-rpc.
